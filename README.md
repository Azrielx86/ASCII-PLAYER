# ASCII PLAYER

This project takes a video file (it should be like Bad Apple animation), convert all frames to ASCII art, and play it in console.

I made it for "Bad Apple!", but it works with other videos.

## Dependences

    pillow
    pygame
    moviepy
    opencv-python
    progressbar
    fpstimer

## Use

Just start the program and put the video name file, if you use the video from the source (or use a video with filename "bad_apple.mp4" and put it on the same directory with the program), you can just press Enter and it will load to the program.

## Video size (Experimental)

You can change the size for the frames generated in ASCII on Advanced Options, by default it is 60x170 characters (you must create the new files again).
